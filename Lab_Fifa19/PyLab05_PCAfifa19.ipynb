    "   1. count/find the rows with missing data;\n",
    "   2. count/find the features (i.e., columns) with missing data;\n",
    "1. Since we are going to perform clustering, **DO NOT REPLACE** the missing/wrong data with information that can be uncorrect and misleading! Unless you are almost $100\\%$ sure that the values you use to replace the \"corrupted\" information are true and/or \"truly neutral\", avoid to fill the missing parts of the datasets! For a clustering task, few but good data are better than many wrong data; then, often it is sufficient to remove the rows with missing/wrong values.\n",
    "   1. If the \"clean\" data (i.e., data without missing/wrong values) are not enough to perform a good clustering, look for those features where the missing/wrong values can be considered as a special value; For example, if in the column \"Job\" of a given dataset there are too many missing values, instead of removing all the corresponding rows, we can consider the missing value as the special job-category value \"Unknown Job\".\n",
    "1. Since we are going to perform dimensionality reduction through the PCA, **DO NOT REMOVE** features (i.e., columns) from the dataset! Few exceptions can include the case of a column with almost all the values missing, etc. "
